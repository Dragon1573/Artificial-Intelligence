## Model Details

- Input Layer: 1 Node
- Hidden Layer(s): 1 Layer with 10 Nodes per layer
- Output Layer: 1 Node
- Activation Function: Relu
    $$
    \text{Relu}(x)=
    \begin{cases}
    0 & x \leq 0 \\
    x & x \gt 0
    \end{cases}
    $$
- Parameters: Linear
    $$
    \hat{y}=(\hat{w}x-\hat{b})
    $$
- Optimize Algorithm: Stochastic Gradient Descent
- Loss Function: Mean-squared Error

## Training Details

- Size of Training Sets: 1000 Scatter Plots
- Traning Sets Generation: $y=x^2+0.2\epsilon$, which $\epsilon$ was generated by `torch.rand()` function
- Training Repeation: 200 Times
- Learning Rate: 0.25

## Notice

1. If the Jupyter Notebook cannot be shown in GitHub, use this [alternative link](https://nbviewer.jupyter.org/github/Dragon1573/Artificial-Intelligence/tree/master/notebooks/Nural_Regression.ipynb). This trouble was mostly met by users in China Mainland.

2. With the above super parameters, you may get different regression result each time. Sometimes it can regress prefectly, but the other times it may over-regression. I didn't spend much time adjusting these super parameters, so if you want to get a greater regression model, please adjust them yourself. Thank you!
